## Setup Instructions

For detailed setup instructions and development guide, please refer to the comprehensive tutorial on Qiita:

ðŸ“– **[PICO4/4Ultra MR App Development Setup Guide](https://qiita.com/afjk/items/3549e9eeb6ed8e301f24)**

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open in Unity 6000.0.48f1** or later
3. **Follow the Qiita tutorial** for detailed PICO development environment setup
4. **Build and deploy** to your PICO4/4Ultra device

## GitHub Actions for Automated Builds

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated Android builds. The workflow automatically triggers on pushes to the main branch and can also be manually executed.

### Setting Up Automated Builds

If you want to use the automated build feature:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Set up the following Secrets** in your repository settings:
   - `UNITY_LICENSE` - Your Unity license file content (see below)
   - `UNITY_EMAIL` - Your Unity account email
   - `UNITY_PASSWORD` - Your Unity account password

### Unity License File (.ulf) Requirement

To run Unity on GitHub Actions, you need a Unity license file (.ulf), even for Personal licenses.

- **Windows:** `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`
- **Mac:** `/Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`

#### Setting Up the License Secret

1. Copy the content of your Unity license file
2. In your forked repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**
3. Create a new secret named `UNITY_LICENSE`
4. Paste the license file content as the secret value
